## üåü Features

- **Advanced XML Parsing**
  - Utilizes a Finite State Machine (FSM) for robust parsing directly on the GPU.
  
- **Parallel Attribute Extraction**
  - Efficiently extracts XML attributes with GPU-optimized methods.
  
- **Hierarchical Data Structures**
  - Represents DOCX elements like Tables, Rows, Cells, and Paragraphs for easy manipulation.
  
- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Minimizes GPU-CPU data transfers and supports multi-GPU environments for scalability.
  
- **Robust Error Handling**
  - Comprehensive XML schema validation with informative error messages.
  
- **Seamless Integration with GPU Libraries**
  - Integrates effortlessly with [RAPIDS cuDF](https://rapids.ai/) for data frames and [cuStrings](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/custrings/) for string manipulation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow the instructions below based on your CUDA version to install the necessary packages.

### 1. Install CuPy

Choose the correct installation command for your CUDA version:

- **For CUDA 12.x:**
  
  ```bash
  pip install cupy-cuda12x
For CUDA 11.x:

pip install cupy-cuda11x
More information is available on the CuPy PyPI page.

2. Install RAPIDS AI
Use the following command to install RAPIDS AI:


pip install rapidsai
Refer to the RAPIDS AI PyPI page for additional details.

3. Install Dask cuDF
Follow the installation instructions available in the Dask cuDF documentation.

Note: This project does not provide support for installation or configuration issues. Please consult the respective documentation for help with any problems.

üèÅ Getting Started
Usage
Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to use the GPU-Accelerated DOCX Parser:


from gpu_docx_parser import GpuDocxParser

# Your DOCX XML content
xml_content = """<your DOCX XML content here>"""

# Initialize the parser
parser = GpuDocxParser(xml_content)

# Parse the document
parsed_elements = parser.parse()

# Process parsed_elements as needed
